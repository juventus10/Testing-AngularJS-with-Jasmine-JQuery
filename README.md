Testing AngularJS with Jasmine-JQuery

In this project we will be experimenting of how
to test AngularJS Applications using karma as the
test runner and jasmine as the testing framework.
In addition of using jasmine we will also use an
extension of jasmine known as jasmine-jquery,
which will allow us to test our AngularJS
Applications more efficently.
